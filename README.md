# 🧠 Basics of Computer Vision & Image Processing

Welcome to the **Computer Vision & Image Processing** module. This repository is designed to introduce you to the foundational concepts and techniques required to process and understand images for further learning in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand how images are represented in digital form.
- Learn basic image processing operations using OpenCV and other libraries.
- Explore techniques like filtering, edge detection, color space transformations, and thresholding.
- Build a foundation for more advanced computer vision tasks (e.g., object detection, segmentation, etc.)
